# Concourse CI Web Docker Image

This image is used to run the [ATC](https://github.com/concourse/atc), web UI and build scheduler alongside a [TSA](https://github.com/concourse/tsa).

## Building the Docker image

To build the `vyshane/concourse-web` docker image, run:

```
./build.sh
```

## Configuration

The following environment variables are available for configuration. `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME_FILE`, `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE`, `POSTGRES_USERNAME_FILE` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` optionally specify file paths to load their respective credentials. This is the preferred way to inject secrets into the container when using Kubernetes.

Environment Variable | Description
--- | ---
BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME | Defaults to `ci` if this, as well as `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME_FILE` are not set.
BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME_FILE | If `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` is not set, the value in this file is used as the basic auth username.
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | Defaults to `password` if both this, as well as `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE` are not set.
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE | If `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` is not set, the value in this file is used as the basic auth password.
SESSION_SIGNING_KEY | Path to the session signing private key file. Currently must be RSA. Used for signing user session tokens, and by the TSA to sign its own tokens in the requests it makes to the ATC.
TSA_HOST_KEY | Path to the TSA host key file. Used for the TSA's SSH server. This is the key whose fingerprint you see when the ssh command warns you when connecting to a host it hasn't seen before.
TSA_AUTHORIZED_KEYS | Path to the TSA's authorized_keys file. Contains the public keys of the workers that are authorized to connect to the TSA.
POSTGRES_HOST | PostgreSQL database host where ATCs will persist and share their scheduling workloads.
POSTGRES_PORT | Port where the PostgreSQL database is listening. Defaults to 5432.
POSTGRES_USERNAME | Username to use when authenticating with PostgreSQL.
POSTGRES_USERNAME_FILE | If `POSTGRES_USERNAME` is not set, the value in this file is used as the PostgreSQL username.
POSTGRES_PASSWORD | Password to use when authenticating with PostgreSQL.
POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE | If `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is not set, the value in this file is used as the PostgreSQL password.
POSTGRES_USE_SSL | Whether to use SSL when connecting to the PostgreSQL server. `YES` or `NO`.
EXTERNAL_URL | URL where ATCs can be reached. E.g. the URL of a load balancer.
PEER_URL | URL used to reach this individual ATC, from other ATCs, i.e. a URL usable within their private network.
